      <h1>Python Course Outline</h1>

      <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Python</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Welcome to Python</h3>
          <p>
            Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for
            its simplicity and readability. Originating in the late 1980s,
            Python has gained popularity due to its versatility in various
            domains such as web development, data science, and automation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting up Python involves installing the interpreter from
            python.org and configuring it on different operating systems like
            Windows, macOS, or Linux. An Integrated Development Environment
            (IDE) like PyCharm or Jupyter Notebook enhances the development
            experience.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Basic Syntax and Variables</h3>
          <p>
            Python's syntax is straightforward, using indentation to indicate
            block structure instead of curly braces or keywords. This ensures
            code clarity but demands consistent formatting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning they can hold
            different types of data (integers, floats, strings) without explicit
            declaration. Basic operations (+, -, *, /) work intuitively across
            these types.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Control Flow</h3>
          <p>
            Conditional statements like if, elif, and else allow branching based
            on conditions. Python's use of truthy and falsy values (e.g., empty
            lists evaluate to false) simplifies conditional logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looping mechanisms include for loops, iterating over sequences like
            lists or ranges, and while loops, executing code until a condition
            becomes false. Exception handling with try-except blocks manages and
            responds to errors gracefully, preventing program crashes.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Module 2: Functions and Modules</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <p>
            Functions encapsulate reusable blocks of code, improving code
            organization and reusability. They can accept parameters and return
            values, facilitating modular programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python supports multiple return values and allows functions to have
            default parameter values, enhancing flexibility. Understanding scope
            is crucial; variables declared inside functions are local unless
            declared otherwise, avoiding unintended side effects.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Modules and Packages</h3>
          <p>
            Python's modular approach enables code organization into files
            called modules, each containing functions, classes, or variables.
            Importing modules makes their functionality accessible across
            scripts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond built-in modules, Python's extensive standard library offers
            modules for tasks like math operations (math), file handling (os,
            shutil), and data manipulation (datetime). External packages,
            managed by tools like pip, expand functionality for specific needs
            (e.g., data analysis with NumPy, Pandas).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Module 3: Data Structures</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Lists and Tuples</h3>
          <p>
            Lists are mutable sequences of elements, allowing dynamic size
            changes and various operations like appending, slicing, and
            iterating. Tuples, in contrast, are immutable sequences typically
            used for fixed collections of heterogeneous data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both structures support indexing and slicing, enabling efficient
            data access and manipulation. Understanding their differences
            ensures optimal use in different programming scenarios.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Dictionaries and Sets</h3>
          <p>
            Dictionaries store key-value pairs, facilitating fast lookups and
            updates based on keys. Python dictionaries maintain insertion order
            from version 3.7 onwards, enhancing predictability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, supporting
            operations like union, intersection, and difference. They are useful
            for tasks requiring distinct values or set operations like filtering
            duplicates from lists.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Module 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Introduction to OOP</h3>
          <p>
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) organizes code around objects,
            combining data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into reusable
            units called classes. Objects are instances of classes, allowing
            multiple instances with distinct states.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism,
            fundamental OOP principles. Classes define blueprints for objects,
            encapsulating data within attributes and behavior within methods.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Inheritance and Polymorphism</h3>
          <p>
            Inheritance enables a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and
            methods from another class (superclass), promoting code reuse and
            hierarchical structure. Subclasses can override superclass methods
            to customize behavior, supporting polymorphismâ€”using objects of
            different classes through a uniform interface.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Module 5: File Handling and Data Processing</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Working with Files</h3>
          <p>
            File handling in Python involves opening, reading, writing, and
            closing files using built-in functions and context managers (with
            statement). Handling exceptions with try-except blocks ensures
            robust file operations, managing errors like file not found or
            permission denied.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Data Processing</h3>
          <p>
            Python excels in data manipulation and analysis. Libraries like
            Pandas provide high-level data structures (DataFrames) and tools for
            cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data. Visualizing data with
            Matplotlib facilitates insights through charts, plots, and graphs,
            enhancing data-driven decision-making.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Module 6: Web Development Basics with Python</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Introduction to Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            Web development combines HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for
            structure and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling web content.
            Python enhances backend functionality, processing requests and
            generating dynamic content.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Backend Development with Python</h3>
          <p>
            Frameworks like Flask and Django simplify backend development,
            handling routing, database interactions, and templating. Flask is
            lightweight and flexible, ideal for small to medium-sized
            applications, while Django offers a full-featured MVC
            (Model-View-Controller) architecture for scalable projects.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Module 7: Project Work and Practical Applications</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Building Projects</h3>
          <p>
            Applying learned concepts through guided projects reinforces
            understanding and proficiency. Projects may include creating a
            calculator with GUI (Graphical User Interface) using Tkinter or a
            todo list manager with SQLite integration for data persistence.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Real-world Applications</h3>
          <p>
            Python's versatility extends to practical applications in data
            science (data analysis, machine learning), automation (scripting,
            task scheduling), and web development (full-stack applications,
            APIs). Real-world examples illustrate Python's relevance and
            applicability across industries.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Module 8: Advanced Topics (Optional)</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming</h3>
          <p>
            Concurrency enables executing multiple tasks concurrently, enhancing
            performance. Python supports asynchronous programming with
            async/await syntax, managing non-blocking I/O operations efficiently
            for tasks like web scraping or real-time applications.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
          <p>
            Writing unit tests using Python's unittest framework validates code
            functionality and prevents regressions. Debugging techniques like
            using print statements, debugging tools (pdb), or integrated
            development environments (IDEs) streamline identifying and fixing
            code errors, ensuring robust applications.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
